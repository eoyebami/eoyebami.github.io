<h2>NTP Client and Server</h2>

The Nework Time Protocol (NTP) is a client/server application. The client software will synchronize its clock to the netwrok time server. They help to synchronize the clocks of devices on a network. Accurate timekeeping is important for many OS, because it is used to timestamp events, synchronize processes, and ensure that data is transmitted and processed in the correct order. 

<h2>NTP Servers</h2>
The NTP servers provide a source of accurate time to the clients on the network. They work by regularly querying a set of reference clocks that are known to be accurate, and uses this information to adjust its own clock and provide the correct time to the client that requests it.
