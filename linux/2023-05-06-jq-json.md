<h1>JQ and Json Parsing</h1>
 

<h3>What is JSON:</h3>
 
* JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data format used to exchange information between applicaions (hence its use in making API calls.
* To process JSON data effectively, Linux prodvides a cli tool called `jq`.

<h3>What is JQ:</h3>
 
* jq (JSON query Language and/or JQL) is a tool that enables users to extract, manipulat, and transform JSON data. With this tool you can filter, sory, or select specificc fields from a JSON file. It can also be used for pretty-printing (making json much more human-readable)
  - ex:
    ```console
    Input:
    $ echo '{"fruit":{"name":"mango","color":"yellow","price":4.20}}' | jq '.'
    
    Output:
    {
      "fruit": {
         "name": "mango",
         "color": "yellow",
         "price": 4.2
      }
    }  
    ```

<h3>Using the JQ command:</h3>
 
The jq command with the `"."` filter simply selects the entire input object and returns it.
-  `echo '{"fruit":{"name":"mango","color":"yellow","price":4.20}}' | jq '.'`
  - This will return the JSON in a much more human-readable format

The jq command can also enable you to retrieve nested objects.
* ex: The values in within the fruit JSON are nested objects (objects within other objects).
   ```json
   {
      "fruit": {
         "name": "mango",
         "color": "yellow",
         "price": 4.2
      }
    }
   ```
- In order to retrieve those values you'd need to use a more specific filter:
  - You can retrieve all nested objects: `echo '{"fruit":{"name":"mango","color":"yellow","price":4.20}}' | jq '.fruit'`
  -  You can retrieve a specific object: `echo '{"fruit":{"name":"mango","color":"yellow","price":4.20}}' | jq '.fruit.name'`
  - You can even retrieve multiple objects: `echo '{"fruit":{"name":"mango","color":"yellow","price":4.20}}' | jq '.fruit.name, .fruit.price'`

The jq command can be used to retrieve objects from an array. Below is an example of a JSON within an array:
* ex:
   ```json
   [
   {
      "name": "Mango",
      "color": "yellow",
      "price": 4.2
   },
   {
      "name": "Grave",
      "color": "green",
      "price": 2.5
   },
   {
      "name": "Blueberry",
      "color": "blue",
      "price": 1.25
   }
   ]  
   ```
- In order to retrieve the values you'd need to modifiy the jq filter:
  - You can retrieve the name of each object within this array: `jq '.[].name'`
    - Output:
      ```json
      "Mango"
      "Grave"
      "Blueberry"
      ```
  - You can also use indexing to retrieve values: `jq '.[1].name'`
    - Output: `"Grave"`
  - You can also retrieve specific values into its own JSON format: `jq '.[] | {name: .name, color: .color}' test.json`
    - Output:
      ```json
      {
        "name": "Mango",
        "color": "yellow"
      }
      {
        "name": "Grave",
        "color": "green"
      }
      {
        "name": "Blueberry",
        "color": "blue"
      }
      ```
  - You can retrieve min and max values from within an array or object that has a type of `number`: `jq '[.[].price] | min' fruits.json`
   - Output: `1.25`
   - Note: Need to first filter for all values that are type num, before using `min` or `max`.
    
<h3>Using functions with JQ:</h3>
 
Functions can also be used to utilize jq more effectively
* Select Function:
  - `jq '.[] | select(.color=="yellow" and .price>=4.2)' fruits.json` : filters for objects in an array which have a `color` value of yellow and a `price` value greater than or equal to 4.2
* Delete Function:
  - `jq 'del(.fruit.color)' fruit.json` : deletes the color key-value pair for the JSON objects
* Key and Value Funtions:
  - key function will list all keys in an object within an array: `jq '.[] | keys' test.json` 
  - value function will list all keys and values in an object within an array `jq '.[] | values' test.json`
* Has function:
  - function will return a boolean depending on the filter:
    - This example is checking if each object has a `name` field: `jq '.[] | has("name")' test.json`
* Map function: 
  - Can filter through each of the objects and provide an ouput
    - This example is ouputting the `price` values found JSON: `jq 'map(.price)' test.json`
    - This example is filtering for all the `price` values and placing it in a JSON with the field `price`: `jq 'map({"price": .price})' test.json`
* Unique Function
  - Can list all unique occurrences of a value
    - This example will list all `color` values in a JSON format and filter for unique values `jq 'map(.color) | unique' test.json`

<h3>Multiple JQ Queries</h3>
 
* JQ can also be used to run multiple queries at once
  - `echo '{"fruit":{"name":"mango","color":"yellow","price":4.20}}' | jq '.fruit.name, .fruit'`
    * This will print the output for both queries
    
    ```json
        "mango"
    {
      "name": "mango",
      "color": "yellow",
      "price": 4.20
    }
    ```

<h3>Manipulate Objects with JQ</h3>
 
* JQ can be used to manipulate the value of objects in a JSON using jq
  - `echo '{"fruit":{"name":"mango","color":"yellow","price":4.20}}' | jq '.fruit.name = "orange" | .fruit.color = "blue"'`
  
  ```json
  {
    "fruit": {
      "name": "orange",
      "color": "blue",
      "price": 4.20
    }
  }
  ```

* You can also specify your own variables when manipulating JSON
  - `echo '{"fruit":{"name":"mango","color":"yellow","price":4.20}}' | jq --arg a "orange" '.fruit.name =$a'`
