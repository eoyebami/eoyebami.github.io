<h1>Regular Expression</h1>

* `Regular Expressions (regex)` allow you to search for specific patterns of text

<h2>Meta Characters</h2>

* Before getting on to `regex` syntax, below are a list of characters that need to be escaped so `regex` can recognize them as a string
  - `.`
  - `[
  - `{`
  - `(`
  - `)`
  - `]`
  - `^`
  - `$`
  - `|`
  - `?`
  - `*`
  - `+`

<h2>Writing Regular Expressions</h2>

```bash
# will mimic vi editor
# search for a literal string
abcdefg
/abc # will search for the literal string 'abc' in the above text

# search for special character
www.google.com
/google\.com # escape special character
```

<h2>Using Regex to Search for Patterns</h2>

* Below is a list of syntaxs that server different purposes in `regex`

  - `.`: matches any character except new line
  - `\d`: matches digits (0-9)
  - `\D`: matches non digit values (0-9)
  - `\w`: matches word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ )
  - `\W`: matches non word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ )
  - `\s`: matches whitespaces (space, tab, newline)
  - `\S`: matches non white spaces (space, tab, newline)
  - `\b`: matches word boundary
  - `\B`: matches non word boundary
  - `^`: matches beginning of a string
  - `$`: matches end of a string
  - `[]`: matches characters in brackets, don't need to escape special characters in this charset
  - `[^ ]`: matches characters NOT in brackets
  - `|`: pipe
  - `()`: group

  ```bash
  # search for phone numbers
  321-555-4321
  123.555.1234
  /\d\d\d[.-]\d\d\d[.-]\d\d\d\d # searchs for 3 digits, either a '.' or '-', and then 3 digits

  # match numbers that start with 8 or 9
  800-588-2300
  900-234-1233
  /[8-9]\d\d[-.]\d\d\d[-.]\d\d\d\d

  # match all lowercase letters 
  ABC
  /[a-z]
  
  # match all letters
  abcABC
  /[a-zA-Z]

  # match all characters that is not a lowercase letter
  123abc
  /[^a-z]

  # match every pattern that ends with 'at' except 'bat'
  bat
  mat
  sat
  /[^b]at$
  ```

<h2>Regular Expression: Quantifiers</h2>

* Below are a list of quantifiers
  
  - `*`: 0 or more
  - `+`: 1 or more
  - `?`: 0 or one
  - `{3}`: exact number
  - `{3,4}`: range of numbers

  ```bash
  # search for phone numbers
  800-588-2300
  934-234-2959
  /\d\{3}[.-]\d\{3}[.-]\d\{4}

  # match all Mr
  Mr. Smith
  Mr Peters
  Mr. T
  /Mr\.?\s[A-Z]\w* # "?" matches either 0 or 1 of the character before it, then matches a space with 's', then matches any uppercase character, and finally watches 0 or more of any word character '\w*'

  # Match all Mr, Ms, Mrs
  Mr. Smith
  Mrs. Peters
  Ms Sams
  /M(r|s|rs)\.?\s[A-Z]\w* # used a group to search for "Mr, Mrs, and Ms"

  # match all email addresses
  CoreyMScafer@gmail.com
  corey.schafer@university.edu
  corey-321-schafer@my-work.net
  /[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+
  ```

<h2>Regular Expression: Group Capturing</h2>

* With regex you can also capture groups for later use

  ```bash
  # match all urls 
  https://www.google.com
  http://coredns.com
  https://youtube.com

  /https?://(www\.)?(\w+)(\.\w+) # 'http' is required, 's' is optional denoted by '?', '://' literal search, 'www.' is optional, (\w+) searches for 1 or more characters, (\.\w+) searches for '.' and any word character 1 or more
  each group will be captured into a var $1 or \1 and so on and so forth
  
  # pull top level domain
  $2$3

  # do not capture group
  # use above domains
  /https?://(?:www\.)?(\w+)(\.\w+) # (?:PATTERN) does not capture the group, ignores it
  
  # pull top level domain 
  $1$2
  ```
