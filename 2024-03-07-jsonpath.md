<h1>JSON PATH</h1>
* `Jsonpath` is a unique way of querying objects from a json file whether it be `maps` or `arrays`
<h2>JSONPATH: Maps</h2>
* When it comes to querying objects in a `map`, you need to start with the root element: `.`
* Ex:

  ```json
   {
  "person": {
    "details": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 30
    },
    "address": {
      "city": "New York",
      "street": "123 Main St"
    }
  }
}
  ```

* In the above case, if we want to retrieve the city `New York` using jsonpath, we would follow the following format:
  - `.`: representing the root element
  - `person`: representing the top level dictionary that contains the `address`
  - `address`: representing the second level dictionary that contains the `city`
  - `city`: which contains out desired value
* Hence, by using the `jq` command, we can `cat fileName.json | jq .person.address.city` to pull that exact value

<h2>JSONPATH: Arrays</h2>
* When it comes to querying objects in an `array`, you'll need to specify brackets when pull objects from that list, still remembering to start with the root element: `.`
* Ex:

  ```json
  {
    "industry": {
        "company": "Apple",
        "location": "New York"
     },
    "employees": [
      {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 30,
        "departments": ["Sales", "Marketing"]
      },
      {
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 35,
        "departments": ["Engineering", "Research", "Development"]
      },
      {
        "name": "Charlie",
        "age": 40,
        "departments": ["Human Resources"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* In the above case if we want to retrieve the department `Research` using jsonpath, we would follow the following format:
  - `.`: representing the root element
  - `employees`: the top level array that contains each `employee`
  - `[1]`: denoting the index of the `employee` whose `department` we are trying to retrieve
  - `departments`: denoting the second level array that contains `Research` in its array
  - `[1]`: denoting the index of the `Research` object
* When pulling from lists, you can specify, using index notation, which values you want to retrieve
  * `[0,2]`: will pull the first and the thrid indices
  * `[0:2]`: will pull from the first to the thrid index
  * `[*]`: will pull all indices
* Hence, by using `jq` command, we can `cat fileName.json | jq .employees[1].departments[1]` to pull that exact value
* NOTE: in this example the `jq` command is used, which is something I'm much more used to that a command like `jpath` which uses a different notation
* NOTE: more information on jq can be found [here](https://eoyebami.github.io/2023-05-06-jq-json.html)
