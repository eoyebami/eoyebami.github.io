<h1>Kubernetes: Pods</h1>
Pods are an abstraction from the host machine to host containers, almost like a namespace
* Ex (basics): 
  - To run a pod in kubernetes you simply put: `kubectl run nginx --name=nginx`
  - To run a deployment in kubernetes you simply put `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx`
    * The `--image` flag will automatically pull the image from the docker registry
<h3>YAML</h3>
Kubernetes can use YAML files to generate objects and resources within a cluster
- All YAML files in K8 must have the same 4 top level definitions
  * `apiVersion`: each resource will have its own apiVersion
  * `kind`: the type of resource you are deploying
  * `metadata`: data that helps uniquely identify an object
    - `name`: name of the object
    - `labels`: used to group objects 
    - `annotations`: for informative purposes, must be in double quotes `""`  
  * `spec`: the specifications for that resource
    - `name`: name of container
    - `image`: image of container
    - `imagePullPolicy`: affect when `kubelet` attempts to pull image (`IfNotPresent`: if not present locally, `Always`: kubelet will pull image if the exact digest cannot be cached locally, `Never`: never pull, will fail if no image is present locally)
    - `ports`: defines exposed ports for container
    - `command`: command to be run in container (similar to `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in docker)
    - `args`: arguments for container

    - secretRef:

```

  * You can also easily generate a yaml for a resource by using a `--dry-run=client -o yaml`
    - This previews the object that would be sent to the cluster, in a yaml format
