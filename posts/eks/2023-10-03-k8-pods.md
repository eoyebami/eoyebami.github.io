<h1>Kubernetes: Pods</h1>
Pods are an abstraction from the host machine to host containers, almost like a namespace
* Ex (basics): 
  - To run a pod in kubernetes you simply put: `kubectl run nginx --name=nginx`
  - To run a deployment in kubernetes you simply put `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx`
    * The `--image` flag will automatically pull the image from the docker registry
<h3>YAML</h3>
Kubernetes can use YAML files to generate objects and resources within a cluster
- All YAML files in K8 must have the same 4 top level definitions
  * `apiVersion`: each resource will have its own apiVersion
  * `kind`: the type of resource you are deploying
  * `metadata`: data that helps uniquely identify an object
  * `spec`: the specifications for that resource

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: <dictionary: contains multiple values>
  name: myapp-pod
  labels: <dictionary within a dictionary>
    apps: myapp
spec:
  containers: <array, since it can define multiple containers>
  - name: nginx-container <the -, defines it is an object in this array>
    image: nginx
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
```

  * You can also easily generate a yaml for a resource by using a `--dry-run=client -o yaml`
    - This previews the object that would be sent to the cluster, in a yaml format
