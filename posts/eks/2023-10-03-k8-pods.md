<h1>Kubernetes: Pods</h1>
Pods are an abstraction from the host machine to host containers, almost like a namespace
* Ex (basics): 
  - To run a pod in kubernetes you simply put: `kubectl run nginx --name=nginx`
  - To run a deployment in kubernetes you simply put `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx`
    * The `--image` flag will automatically pull the image from the docker registry
<h3>YAML</h3>
Kubernetes can use YAML files to generate objects and resources within a cluster
- All YAML files in K8 must have the same 4 top level definitions
  * `apiVersion`: each resource will have its own apiVersion
  * `kind`: the type of resource you are deploying
  * `metadata`: data that helps uniquely identify an object
    - `name`: name of the object
    - `labels`: used to group objects 
    - `annotations`: for informative purposes, must be in double quotes `""`  
  * `spec`: the specifications for that resource
    - `name`: name of container
    - `image`: image of container
    - `imagePullPolicy`: affect when `kubelet` attempts to pull image (`IfNotPresent`: if not present locally, `Always`: kubelet will pull image if the exact digest cannot be cached locally, `Never`: never pull, will fail if no image is present locally)
    - `ports`: defines exposed ports for container
    - `command`: command to be run in container (similar to `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in docker)
    - `args`: arguments for container

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: <dictionary: contains multiple values>
  name: myapp-pod
  labels: <dictionary within a dictionary>
    apps: myapp
  annotations:
    appVersion: "1.x"
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity: (labels should exist first)
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: size
            operator: In
            values:
            - Small
  tolerations: (taints should exist)
  - key: "color"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "blue"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  priorityClassName: high-priority (name of priorityClass to assign to Pod that will determine its priority for scheduling)
  containers: <array, since it can define multiple containers>
  - name: nginx-container <the -, defines it is an object in this array>
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
      name: http-port
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
    command: ["sleep"]
    args: ["1000"]
```

  * You can also easily generate a yaml for a resource by using a `--dry-run=client -o yaml`
    - This previews the object that would be sent to the cluster, in a yaml format
