<h1>Volumes</h1>
* Volumes are a way to persist data generated or to be used by a pod
  - All regular volumes are ephemeral and are deleted once a pod is terminated
* There are many different types of volumes that can be used
  - `hostPath`: dedicated volume mounted unto a directory in the host machine
    * Not recommended for multi node clusters
    * If a pod dies and spins up in a new node, it cannot access data in the other node
    * An alternative would be to configure a CSP block storage device
  - `emptyDir` : volume mounted onto the host machine, temporary FS, deleted when pod is deleted
  - `ConfigMaps`: stores a `configMap` object as a volume in the pod
  - `secret`: stores a `secret` object as a volume in the pod
* When a volume is created it needs to be mounted on a set path in the container within a pod

```yml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /opt # mount path of volume in container
      name: data-volume # name of volume
    - name: app-properties
      mountPath: /path/in/container
    - name: app-secrets
      mountPath: /path/in/container
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: data-volume 
    hostPath:
      path: /data
      type: Directory # potential values are; DirectoryOrCreate, Directory, FileorCreate, File, Socket, CharDevice, BlockDevice
  - name: app-properties
    configMap: # mounts the configmap as a file in the pod
      name: <config-map-name>
  - name: app-secrets
    secret: # mounts each secret as a seperate file in the pod; 3 data attributes = 3 files
      secretName: <secret-name>
  - name: empty-volume
    emptyDir:
      sizeLimit: 500Mi # can specifiy a limit to the size of this empty directory
```

<h2>Volumes: SubPath</h2>
* SubPaths are used to share one volume for multiple purposes in a single pod
  - Creates a subdirectory within a volume's Filesystem in the volumeMount path
  - Mainly for multi-container pod
* SubPathExprs are used to create names for `subPaths` from environment variables specified in pods
* NOTE: downwardAPI fieldRefs set into a `subPath` will not receive any updates made to the refs

```yml
spec:
    containers:
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql
      env:
      - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        value: "xxxx"
      - name: POD_NAME
        valueFrom:
          fieldRef:
            apiVersion: v1
            fieldPath: metadata.name
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        name: site-data
        subPathExpr: $(POD_NAME) # used downwardAPI variable to set subPath
    - name: php
      image: php:7.0-apache
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/www/html
        name: site-data
        subPath: html
    volumes:
    - name: site-data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-lamp-site-data
```
