<h1>Container Network Interface</h1>
 
* The process crt uses when interacting with network interfaces are pretty similar across all container orchestration tools
  - More info defined [here](https://eoyebami.github.io/k8s/docker/2024-12-19-docker-networking.html)

* Rather than having to rebuild the entire process everytime you want to create a new cri, all you need to do is develop a crt that is able to call upon a program that will handle it for you
  - The bridge program, which contains all the essentials for connecting a container to a bridge network on a host machine
  - The crt would be responsible for creating the netns before calling upon the bridge program to handle the rest
    * `bridge add <cid> /var/run/netns/<namespace>`

* CNI was created to develop a set of standards that all programs for follow to be compatible across all crt
  - These programs invoked by a crt are called plugins, the example with the bridge program would be called a bridge plugin

* Docker does not follow this standard, and instead uses a CNM (container network model)
  - Workarounds include running the container without a network and manually invoking the bridge plugin yourself
    * `docker run --network none nginx && bridge add <cid> /var/run/netns/<namespace>`
  - This is what kubernetes ddoes when using docker a its crt

<h2>CNI Standards</h2>
 
* CRT must create the netns and identify the network the container must attach to
* CRT must be able to invoke the Network Plugin when the container is ADDed and DELeted
* Network Config must be in JSON format

<h2>CNI in Kubernetes</h2>
 
* The CNI configurations is defined in the `kubelet` service under these 3 flags:
  - `--network-plugin=cni`
  - `--cni-bin-dir=/opt/cni/bin`
  - `--cni-conf-dir=/etc/cni/net.d`

* Each CNI plugin has a conf file defining how it will function
  ```console
     $ cat  /etc/cni/net.d/10-bridge.conf
     {
       "cniVersion": "9.2.0,
       "name": "mynet",
       "type": "bridge",
       "isGateway": true, # defines that a ip should be given bridge so it can act as gateway
       "ipMasq": true, # defines if NAT should be enabled for masquerading
       "ipam": {
          "type": "host-local", # defines that ip addr are managed locally on this host, can be set to a DHCP server to be configured remotely
          "subnet": "10.22.0.0/16", # defines subnet for range of ip addr assigned to pods
          "routes": [
             { "dst": "0.0.0.0/0" } # route for gateway
          ]
       }
     }
  ```
