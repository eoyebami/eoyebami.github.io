<h1>Ingress</h1>
 
* `Ingress` is a way to manage external access to services within a cluster. You can configure it to:
  - Route traffic to services based on rules
  - L7 Loadbalancing traffic at HTTP/HTTPS to direct traffic to services
  - Single entry point to different services
* Ingress is not deployed by default on a cluster, you will need to choose an `Ingress Controller` in order to create `Ingress Resources`

<h2>Ingress Controllers</h2>
 
* Since no controller is installed by default, choose one of the many following solutions:
  - HAproxy
  - Istio (my default choice)
  - GCP LoadBalancer (supported by k8 project)
  - Contour
  - Nginx (supported by k8 project)
* These controllers will be installed on the cluster as just another object

<h3>Ingress Controllers: Nginx</h3>
 
* Nginx ingress controller manifest files can be found [here](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/installing-nic/)
  - The configuration for the nginx deployment can be found in its configmap, where you can modify it to suit your purposes
* This is essentially the LB

<h2>Ingress Resources</h2>
 
* As stated earlier, resources for the controller are used to define how traffic will be balanced to services at L7
  - Define it paths at an endpoint route to certain services
  - Define if the domain itself will route to a certain services
* This is basically where you define the rules for this LB
