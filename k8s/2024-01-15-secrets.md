<h1>Secrets</h1>
* Secrets are similar to `ConfigMaps` in the sense that they abstract configuration data from the pods. However, they are specifically meant to hold sensitive configuration data
  - There are different types of secrets that can be created
    1. `opaque`: generic
    2. `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`: typically managed by k8; more info [here](https://eoyebami.github.io/k8s/2024-01-29-service-accounts.html)
    3. `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`: stores docker registry authentication information; more info [here](https://eoyebami.github.io/k8s/2024-01-31-image-security.html)
    4. `kubernetes.io/tls`: stores TLS certificates

* create the secret with the sensitive data
  - imperative:
    * `kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=<key-name>=<value>`: used to create individual key/value pairs in the object
    * `kubectl create secret generic <secret-name> --from-file=<key-name>=app-config.properties`: used to add the contents of the file in a key as a multi-lined string

  - declarative:
    * `kubectl apply -f <secret.yaml>`
    * YAML:

   ```yml
   apiVersion: vi
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: app-secret
   data:
     DB_HOST: xxxx # base64encoded
     DB_USER: xxxx # base64encoded
     DB_Password: xxxx # base64encoded
     DB_OTHER: |- # base64encoded multi-lined string
       port: xxxx
   ```

* Inject the secret data into the pod

```yml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
    name: http-port
    command: ["nginx"]
    env:
    - name: USER
      valueFrom: # injects a key/value pair from the secret as an environment variable
        secretKeyRef:
          name: <secret-name>
          key: <key-name>
    envFrom: # injects the entire secret as an environment variables
    - secretRef:
        name: <secret-map-name>  
    volumeMounts:
    - name: app-properties
      mountPath: /path/in/container
  volumes:
  - name: app-properties
    secret: # mounts each secret as a seperate file in the pod; 3 data attributes = 3 files
      secretName: <secret-name>
```

* NOTE: there are much safer ways to store secrets, you can abstract them out of the cluster itself and store them in [HashiCorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-sidecar)
  - Do more testing on this in your own cluster

<h2>Enabling Secret Encryption at Rest</h2>
* Within the ECTD Server, all secrets are stored in plaintext, they aren't base64encoded or encrpyted. You must enable encryption yourself by modifying the ETCD server
  - This is usually taken care of if you use a CSP, but on-prem clusters need to be done manually.

* This will assume your etcd server is running as a static pod, but this can be accomplished if it is running directly on the server
* Create an `EncryptionConfiguration` YAML
  - There are multiple types of providers you can use depending on what you're looking for
    * More information on the type of keys can be found [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/)
    * To generate a key run `head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64`; however this insecure because it is stored directly yaml file. A Managed KMS can resolve this
 
```yml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
resources:
  - resources: (which resource do you want to encrypt)
      - secrets 
      - configmaps
    providers:
      #  Which ever provider is listed first will take precedence
      #
      - identity: {} # plain text, in other words NO encryption, this would be placed at the bottom to allow API-Server to access plain-text secret
      - aesgcm:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: xxxx
            - name: key2
              secret: xxxx
      - aescbc:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: xxxx
            - name: key2
              secret: xxxx
      - secretbox:
          keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: xxxx
```

* Use the `EncryptionConfiguration` YAML in the api-server configuration. Which in this case is held in the static-pod config
  - Mount the yaml file as a volume in the static pod

* Verify its functionality
  - create a new secret (as only secrets created after this added config will be encrypted)
  - use `etcdctl` to read out the secret from etcd `ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl get /registry/secrets/default/secret1 [...] | hexdump -C`
    * verify the secret is prefixed with the right provider type: `k8s:enc:<provider-key>:`
  - verify you can retrieve secrets in your cluster: `kubectl get secret <secret-name> -o yaml`

* Encrypt all secret data in etcd
  - `kubectl get secrets -A -o json | kubectl replace -f -` (api-server will read all secrets and update them with the same data using server side encyrption)
  - After this you can remove the `identity` provider from the `EncryptionConfiguration` yaml so `kube-apiserver` can no longer retrieve the access the plain-text secret without going through the providers encryption key
