<h1>Jobs</h1>
 
* `Jobs` create one or more `Pods` and will continue to retry execution of the `Pods` until the specified number of them executes successflly
* Often `Jobs` are used to run one off tasks and aren't usually meant to be kept up and running forever like regular Pods

  ```yml
  apiVersio: batch/v1
  kind: Job
  metadata:
    name: job-test
  spec:
    completions: 10 # how many times a pod most terminate successfully
    parallelism: 3 # how many pods should run in parallel
    backoffLimit: 3 # how many times it can fail before the job reports as a failure
    ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100 # how many seconds the job can live before being cleaned up
    podFailurePolicy: # defines what should define a failure for the pod
      rules:
      - action: FailJob
        onExitCodes: # if container main reports exitCode 42, then fail the pod
          containerName: main      # optional
          operator: In             # one of: In, NotIn
          values: [42]
      - action: Ignore             # one of: Ignore, FailJob, Count
        onPodConditions:
        - type: DisruptionTarget   # indicates Pod disruption for things like maintenance, not necessarily becuase the pod failed the task
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: test
          image: ubuntu
          command:
          - "sleep"
          - "1000"
        restartyPolicy: never
  ```

<h2>Indexed Jobs</h2>
 
* Indexed `Job` in kubernetes are a type of `Job` resource that allows you to run multiple tasks in parallel with a unique index
  - This is great for `Jobs` that are meant to process a large pull of items in parallel
  - Allows you to distribute and parallelize tasks while keeping track of the status of each individual task
    * The status of this job will display which indexes succeeded and failed with `.status.completedIndexes` and `.status.failedIndexes` respectively

  ```yml
  apiVersio: batch/v1
  kind: Job
  metadata:
    name: job-test
  spec:
    completions: 10 # how many times a pod most terminate successfully
    parallelism: 3 # how many pods should run in parallel
    ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100 # how many seconds the job can live before being cleaned up
    completionMode: Indexed # Required for the success policy
    backoffLimitPerIndex: 1  # maximum number of failures per index
    maxFailedIndexes: 5 # how many indexes can fail in total 
    successPolicy:
      rules:
      - succeededIndexes: 0,2-3 # if these indexes succeed, the the job will terminate successfully
        succeededCount: 1 # once the each of the indexes marked above succeeds once, then this job will succeed
        # if only succeededIndexes is specified then once all of these indexes specified succeed the job succeeds
        # if only succeededCount is specified then once the number of suceessfully indexes reaches the count, then this job succeeds
    ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100 # how many seconds the job can live before being cleaned up
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: test
          image: ubuntu
          command:
          - "sleep"
          - "1000"
        restartyPolicy: never
  ```
