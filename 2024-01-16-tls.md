<h1>TLS</h1>
* TLS, is a method of encrypting data between a server and a client to prevent hacking and stolen data
* We're going to go over an example of communication between server and client without this encryption to protect your data
  - You want to login to your bank account, going through http
  - Be logging in you're sending your data to the server, unecrypted (in plaintext)
    * Someone can listening in on that network's traffic can easily retrieve this data in plaintext, and thereby hack your account
* There are two types of encryption strategies that can be used to protect your data
  - symmetric encryption
  - asymmetric encryption
<h2>Symmetric Encryption</h2>
* Symmetric Encryption used one key to both encrypt and decrypt data, so communication between client/server must also include an exchange of these keys as well
* There many steps when it comes to generating a symmetric key and how it works
  - You generate a key (which is basically just a set of randome numbers and letter)
  - You used said key yo encrypt your login information
  - This data is then sent through your network to the server
    * The hacker listening for traffic, can only pull the encrypted data
    * However, the server also has this issue, because it doesn't have the key it needs to decrypt this data
  - The client will need to send this key to the server, so that it can decrpyt the data
    * The hacker listenting for traffic, can also pull this key as well
<h2>Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
* Asymmetric Encryption used a pair of different keys, one to encrypt and one to decrypt your data, no exchange is necessary
  - Using a private and a public key
    * Private and public can encrypt or decrypt data
    * If you encrypt with one, then you can only decrypt with the other
    * Best practice is to encrypt with your public key and decrypt with your private key
  - You use this when you want to secure access to a server
    * `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`: to generate the private and public key for ssh purposes
    * You add the key to the user's `.ssh/authorized_keys` file in the server
    * Then you specify your private key when you ssh to the server: `ssh -i /path/to/privatekey user@server`
* Back to the earlier example with the banking system, we want to securely pass our symmetric key to the server, so it can decrypt the information
  - We generate a private and public key on the server
    * `openssl genrsa -out key-name.key 1024`: generates private key
    * `openssl rsa -in key-name.key -pubout > pub-key.pem`: outputs public key
  - When you access the server using https, the browser retrieves the servers public key
  - The user's browser uses this public key to enrypt the symmetric key it used to encrypt the user credentials for their bank account
  - The server uses its private key to decrypt the symmetric that was previously encrypted by the browser
  - The client can now send over its login details after encrpyting it with its symmetric key
  - The server will use the symmetric key copy it has, to decrypt the bank login details
* NOTE: we used both symmetric and asymmetric keys together to enable encyrption
  - We use asymmetric encryption to encrypt the symmetric key exchange
  - We use symmetric encryption to encrpyt all future communication between the server and the client
* NOTE: In order to validate the server, the public key sent by the server to the client will always be sent with a certificate
<h2>Certificates</h2>
* Certificates are used to validate that you are who you claim you are. When this public key exchange occurs from server to client, this public key is sent inside of a cert that is signed by a CA
  - `openssl req -new -key <key> -out <key.csr> -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/O, Inc./CN=domain"`: generates a csr(certificate signing request)
    * The certificate authority validate your request then they sign and send the certificate back to you 
    * Certs with public keys are usually suffixed with `*.crt` or `*.pem`
    * Private keys are suffixed with `*.key` or `*-key.pem`
* Your browser automatically checks and validates that your certificate was signed by a CA
  - In order to prevent people form forging CA signatures, CA's have their own asymmetric private keys to sign the certificates
  - Browsers typically have all the public keys built into them, which validate that the cert was signed by the CAs themself
* Which these 3 attributes we now have a secure TLS connection and communication
  1. admin secures ssh access to server with asymmetric keys
  2. server creates its own openssl asymmetric keys
  3. server creates a csr
  4. ca signes the cert with its private key and sends back to server
  5. end user accesses server using http
  6. server sends over cert containing public key
  7. browser with built in CA public key, approves signature and retrieves public key
  8. browser sends over symmetric key encrypted by retrieved public key
  9. server retrieves symmetric key and decrypts it using its private key
  10. communication is now established securing with symmetric key # all future exchanges of data will occur through this symmetric key

* NOTE: MTLS, is where the server will validate that the user is who they say they are by the signature on their symmetric key
