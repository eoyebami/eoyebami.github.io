<h1>DNS</h1>
* DNS stands for `Domain Name System` and it's an integral part of how devices communicate with one another
<h2>Name Resolution</h2>
* Devices within similar networks can ping one another through the ips assigned to those devices by said network
* However its possible to assign a name to a device and have the source machine reach the destination machine through said name
  - Simply add an entry into the `/etc/hosts` file of the source instances, pointing that name to the ip of the destination machine
    ```yml
       cat <<EOF >> /etc/hosts
       xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx db
       EOF
    ```
<h2>DNS Server</h2>
* The problem with using name resolution on its own, its the overhead of managing all of those host files across a large network, unless you're using a provisioning software like Ansible
* In any case, centralizing all of these host files into a singular DNS machine is most optimal
  - All other devices in that network would resolve all names through the DNS server
    * Despite this, a server will look into its own `/etc/hosts` file for an entry before checking the dns server
    * This order can be modified in the `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file by modifying the line `hosts: files dns` to `hosts: dns files` to check the dns first before checking its own host file
  - Add the ip of the dns server into the `/etc/resolv.conf` file on each system
    ```yml
       cat <<EOF >> /etc/resolv.conf
       nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    ```

* You can also forward any unknown entries to other nameservers, for example 8.8.8.8 is known for recognizing a plethora of public hosts
  ```yml
       cat <<EOF >> /etc/hosts
       xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx db
       Forward All to 8.8.8.8 # forwards all unknown hosts to this nameserver
       EOF
    ```

<h2>Domain Names</h2>
* Domain Names are how ips translate to names on the public internet

| Sections | Description          |
| ---      | ---                  | 
| .        | root                 | 
| .com     | top level domain     |
| google   | domain               |
| www      | subdomain            |

* When you make a call to a public domain name it follows a specific path
  1. It will hit your internal DNS server, which will not recognize it and forward your request to the internet
  2. A root DNS server will pick up your request and forwards it to a top level domain DNS server
  3. The top level domain DNS server will forward you to google
  4. The google DNS server will resolve the ip for the server hosting the www subdomain
* This ip may be cached by your internal DNS server for faster resolution for future requests

<h2>Search Domain</h2>
* You can add a search to your `/etc/resolv.conf` if you would like to make a request to a server by only specifying its subdomain
  - `ping web` instead of `ping web.mycompany.com`  
* For example, in a company's internal network, you can add the following to resolve by its subdomain and the DNS is smart enough to fill out the remainder of the domain for you
   ```yml
      cat <<EOF >> /etc/resolv.conf
      nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
      search  mycompany.com prod.mycompany.com # alternative names
   ```
<h2>Record Types</h2>
* There are different kinds of record types that can be inputted into a DNS server or a hosts file

| Record Type | Type                           |
| ---         | ---                            |
| A           | resolves ipv4                  |
| AAAA        | resolves ipv6                  |
| CNAME       | resolves to other Domain Names |

<h2>Commands for DNS querying</h2>
* There are certain commands you can use to query information about a domain name
  - `nslookup www.google.com`
  - `dig www.google.com`
  * NOTE: only queries the DNS server and will ignore any local `/etc/hosts` file
