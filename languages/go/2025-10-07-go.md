## GoLang
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## Overview
* `GoLang` was created to combine the ease of an interpreted language (such as `python`) with the efficiency of a compiled language (such as `c++`)
* `Go` is a compiled programming language, meaning the source code is translated into machine language

## Getting Started

* Every `go` program must start with a package declaration
  - `package main`: special package declaration that tells `Go compiler` this package should compile as an executable program rather than a shared library
    * When you run `go run` against this program, go looks for `package main` and then runs the `main()`, if `package main` is removed then this program won't compile as an executable
* Imported packages must be in `""` (i.e. `import "fmt"`)
  - In the example below we call the statement `fmt.Println()`
    * The `.` operator is known as the `member access operator`, and it is used to access members of a package
* All comments are prepended with `//`
  - Go also supports multiline comments 
    
    ```go
    /*
    multi
    line
    */
    ```

```go
package main // packages are go's way of organizing and reusing code

import "fmt" // standard library used for format I/O like printing to the console

func main() { // the entrypoint of the go program in the main package, must be defined when package main is called, package main must also be defined when main() is used when creating an executable (not a library or package)
    fmt.Println("Hello World!") 
}
```
