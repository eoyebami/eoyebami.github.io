<h1>Python</h1>

* `Python` is a language intended to be `human-readable(high-level languange)` and also readable for computer to process. 
* We interact with the cpus, through `machine language(low-level language)`; the language of computers
  - Written in ones and zeros
  * However this programming language is complex, so we use various interpreters to translate human-readable languages like `python` to a `machine language` version that the machine can understand 
* Programming language translators fall into 2 general categories:
  - `Interpreters`: reads, parses, and interprets source code
    * `Python` is an interpreter
    * Its nature is to have an interactive conversation
  - `Compilers`: needs to be handed the entire program in a file, then translates the source code to `machine language`
    * `Go, Rust, and C` are examples of compiling languages
    * It will then put the stdout of that translation into a file for later execution
    * Examples of this translated files can be `.jar` or `.exe` files, which are unreadable if you cat them

* `Python's` interpreter is written in `C`, which is a compile programming language
  - `Python` is a program itself that is complied into machine code
  - You can see it in your machine as an executable: `python.exe`

<h2>What is a Program</h2>

* A `program` is a sequence of `python` statements written to achieve a task
* The following are the building blocks to creating a `program`:
  - `input`: get data frm the outside world, like reading a file or from some input device
  - `output`: displayed result of executed `program`
  - `sequential execution`: running in order given in script
  - `conditional execution`: conditionals dictate what will run
  - `repeated execution`: loops
  - `reuse`: functions & vars
 
* When writing a `program`, we use a text editor to pass in the instructions into a file which is appended with `.py`, marking it as a python script
  - You'd run that script by using:
 
    ```python 
    python app.py
    # calling the python interpreter to read the source code from this file
    ```

<h2>Python Errors</h2>

* There are three general types of errors, you'll encounter while programming with `python`
  - `Syntax Errors`: grammatical errors in your code
  - `Logic Errors`: error in order of statements
  - `Semantic Errors`: error in execution, code doesn't do what its intended to do
