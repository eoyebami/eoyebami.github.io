<h2>Systemd Service</h2>

The systemctl command is used to manage systemd services. A systemd service is configured using a systemd unit file which can be found in `/etc/systemd/system`. 
There are 3 sections in a sytem unit file:

|[Unit]   |This section provides metadata about the service unit, such as description and dependencies|
|[Service]|Defines how the service should be executed and managed                                     |    
|[Install]|Specified when the service should be started                                               |    

You will create a systemd unit file, preferrably named after your application, with the prefix `.service (ex: my_app.service).`
Below we have an example of a systemd unit file:
  ex:
```
[Unit]
Description=My python web application (extra info about the service, that a user can specify)
After=network.target (indicates that the service depends on the network being available)
Requires= [another unit] (indicates units that must be started before this unit)
Requisite= [another unit] (indicates units that must be started before this unit, and will fail if they do not start)
BindsTo= [another unit] (Units that should be started and stopped with this unit)
Before= [another unit] (Units that should be started before this unit)
After= [another unit] (Unit that should be started after this unit)
AllowIsolate=yes (allows the unit to create a new namespace using the unshare system call, which isolates themselves from the parent ns, however the unit processes must explicitly make the call).

[Service]
User=myappuser (indicates the user the service should be run as)
Group=myappgroup (indicates the group the service should be run as)
WorkingDirectory:/opt/webapp (indicartes working directory of service)
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/code/my_app.py (specifying code that you will be using to start your application)
ExecStartPre=/opt/code/configure_db.sh (command to be run before the start of service)
ExecStartPost=/opt/code/email_status.sh (command to be run after the start of the service)
Restart=always (will automatically restart service if the service ever crashes)
RestartSec=5 (indicates delay before attempting to restart)
ExecReload=/opt/shell.sh (command or script to be run to reload the service)
ExecStop=/opt/code/email_notice.sh (command or script to be run to stop the service)
OOMScoreAdjust=-900 (Out-of Memory score; value the kernel uses to determine which processes to kill when the system is low on memory, from -1000 to 1000, the higher the number the more likely it will be killed)
LimitNOFILE=16815 (the maximum number of file descriptors that can be opened by a process started by that unit)
ProtectSystem=full (ensures the unit cannot modify files or directories outside of its own file system namespace [partitioning of the file system into separate views, done with mount system command]; strict: gives read-only access to certain system directories (/usr/local and /home, full: entire fs is made read-only except /usr/local and /home, which are write; readonly: only /usr, /bin, /sbin, and /lib are made read-only)
PrivateTMP=true (creates a private /tmp directory for this unit, separate frome the global /tmp; this is enabled by default)
PrivateDevices=true (creates a private /dev directory for unit)

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target (configures service to start after multi-user-target(a unit) run level is started: now service can be enabled to start at server bootup, adds unit file to /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants directory; will be spun up because of this symlink)
```

Now you run the `systemctl daemon-reload` to let systemd know that there is a new service configured.
Then you can run the `systemctl start my_app` to start the service.

<h2>What is a user.target?</h2>
A systemd target unit that  is used to start all non-graphical, multi-user services on the system.
    |Systemd target unit | Description |
    |---                 | ---
    | sysinit.target     | Responsible for starting the system initialization services, such as root file system, system clock, and initializing network interfaces|
    | basic.target       | It is used to start the servies that are required for basic system functionality, such as device drivers, and the init system itself    |
    | multi-user.target  | Is a systemd target unit that boots up network-facing capabilities such as servers, NFS, and other similar services. Usually after multi-user.target unit boots up, users can access the server. Is responsible for starting the services required for multi-user operation|
 <h2>What is a File Descriptor?</h2>
When you open a file, the OS creates an entry to represent that file and store that information about that opened file. Similarly this occues when you open a network socket, pipe (which is a named pipe, can be done using a `mkfifo` command; you can use a pipe to pass data from one program to another program without writing to a file first( mkfifo mypipe; ./generate.sh > mypipe; ./process.sh < mypipe), or other I/O resources
