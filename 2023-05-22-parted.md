<h1>Disks and Partitions with Parted</h1>
There are multiple ways to format or partition a disk. In this example we will be using the `parted` command, which provides the following benefits:
* You can swap what time of partition table a disk is using, from `MBR` to `GUID(Globally Unique Identifier)` partition table
  - The GUID table can create partitions up to 9.4ZB (zettabytes) for larger disks is an example of the benefits of using the tabe-le
<h3>Creating a Partition</h3>
* First check to see if the disk is avaliable on the OS
  - `lsblk` or `df -Th` if it has already been mounted
  - `umount` if it is already mounted
* Use `parted` command to access the utility
  - `sudo parted /dev/<disk_name>` or `sudo parted -l` to list all disks and their partitions
  - The output should be as follows:

```console 
Model: Xen Virtual Block Device (xvd)
Disk /dev/xvda: 10.7GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt
Disk Flags:

Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name                  Flags
128     1049kB  11.5MB  10.5MB  fat16        EFI System Partition  boot, esp
127     11.5MB  12.6MB  1049kB               BIOS Boot Partition   bios_grub
 1      12.6MB  8590MB  8577MB  xfs          Linux


Model: Xen Virtual Block Device (xvd)
Disk /dev/xvdf: 8590MB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: msdos
Disk Flags:

Number  Start  End  Size  Type  File system  Flags
```

* Create a Partition:
  - list all current partitions: `p`
  - remove any unneeded partitions: `rm`
  - change the partition table the disk is using: `mklabel gpt` or `mklabel mbt`
  - created a new partition: `mkpart`
    * Partition name? 
    * File system type?
    * Start (similar to first sector in fdisk)
    * End (similar to last sector in fdisk)
  - create a fs for that partition: `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf1`
  - mount the new partition
* run a `resize2fs /dev/xvdf1` to update the kernel if any resizing of a partition was done
<h5>Updating /etc/fstab</h5>
Updating the `/etc/fstab` will ensure that the disk is automatically mounted at boot up of the server
* To mount a disk permanently, you need to first retrieve the UUID of the fs of the disk
  - blkid (or block id,); `sudo blkid` will display information of all blokc devices including the UUID
* Input data in /etc/fstab
